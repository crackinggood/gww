about-author: >
  Writer, illustrator and problem solver. I create engaging press releases
  for restaurant openings and special events, hype a monthly dance night 
  and make easily digestible copy for websites. I report on food, culture,
  style and things-to-do for local publications and businesses. I suggest
  things-to-do and places to go for hotel visitorâ€™s guides and maps. I teach
  Photoshop classes to corporate clients. I also lend a hand with marketing
  materials and website updates for a couple of local non-profit organizations.
