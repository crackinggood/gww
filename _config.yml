# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# # Site settings
# # These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# # you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# # You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# # in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  things-to-do and places to go for hotel visitorâ€™s guides and maps. I teach
  Photoshop classes to corporate clients. I also lend a hand with marketing
  materials and website updates for a couple of local non-profit organizations.
