about-author: 'Writer, illustrator and problem solver. I create engaging press releases
  for restaurant openings and special events, hype a monthly dance night  and make
  easily digestible copy for websites. I report on food, culture, style and things-to-do
  for local publications and businesses. I suggest things-to-do and places to go for
  hotel visitorâ€™s guides and maps. I teach Photoshop classes to corporate clients.
  I also lend a hand with marketing materials and website updates for a couple of
  local non-profit organizations.
